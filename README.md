## Description

This question game is designed to show you throughout the quiz which questions you get right and which you get wrong. Also you will have a final score that is posted in the hishscore section of the app. 

This question game was by far the most difficult challenge so far. The many aspect of javascript and CSS really unfolded for me during this challenge and I can only look forward to developing my skills in future projects. This game is intended to be fun and interactive.
